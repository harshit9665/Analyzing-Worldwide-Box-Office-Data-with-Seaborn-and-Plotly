# Analyzing-Worldwide-Box-Office-data-with-Seaborn-

This project consists of The Movie Database (TMDB) Box Office Prediction data set.

Problem Statement:
1. Can we build models to accurately predict movie revenue?
2. Could the results from these models be used to further increase revenue?

I have tried to answer these questions by way of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in this project. The statistical data visualization library Seaborn is like workhorse to generate interactive, publication-quality graphs.

## Various Tasks in this Project are-> 
### Part 1 Using Seaborn
1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Visualizing the Target Distribution
3. Comparing Film Revenue to Budget
4. Do Official Homepages Impact Revenue?
5. Distribution of Languages across Films
6. Common Words in Film Titles and Descriptions
7. How do Film Descriptions Impact Revenue?

### Part 2 Using Plotly
1. Analyzing Movie Release Dates
2. Preprocessing Features
3. Create Features Based on Release Date
4. Using Plotly to Visualize the Number of Films Per Year
5. Number of Films and Revenue Per Year
6. Do Release Days Impact Revenue?
7. Relationship between Runtime and Revenue
